title: Freedonia website SSP introduction
---

A Freedonia SSP (as well as one for USA) comprises:
* Narrative: A narrative description (from `markdowns/README.md` and
  other content under `markdowns/docs`
* Standards: A description of standards and relevant controls (generated from _components_ and _dependencies/systems_ references in the `opencontrol.yaml`)
* Components: Links to details of the components (also generated from `opencontrol.yaml`)

While a README.md may be sufficient to provide a narrative introduction
for an SSP, it's likely you'll need to go into more depth.

But since this directory is only scratch data for regression testing,
we won't bother with that here.
