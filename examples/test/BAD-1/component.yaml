        This component references a nonexistant control.
        This is not an error -- components may satisfy multiple standards,
        some of which may be omitted from a particular SSP.

        However, there should probably still be some kind of warning
        somwehere if the Standard is known but the Control isn't found there.
        TBDWL.
