Genosha, Inc., a small engineering firm, found themselves faced
with the task of NIST 800-171 compliance, but had absolutely no idea where
to start. On top of that just last Thursday one of their partners asked
them to fill out a [CIS] security checklist, which they had never even
heard of before.

They decided that their best approach would be:

- Document their system in terms of the NIST-800-53 catalogue
- Use the control mapping tables in NIST-800-171 Appendix D
  to verify -171 compliance
- ... and find a similar mapping for the CIS checklist ...
- ... and whatever other requirements might come up next month ...

Clearly they still have a long way to go, but the
[OpenControl] framework provides a solid starting point.
