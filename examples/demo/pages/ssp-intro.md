title: System Security Plan - Template
---

## Overview

[NIST-800-18] provides a sample information system security plan template
in Appendix A.  It also notes:

> Agencies may be using other formats and choose to update those to reflect
> any existing omissions based on this guidance. This is not a mandatory
> format; it is recognized that numerous agencies and information security
> service providers may have developed and implemented various approaches
> for information system security plan development and presentation to
> suit their own needs for flexibility.

But this is as good a place to start as any.

## Template

- Information System Name/Title
- Information System Categorization
- Information System Owner
- Authorizing Official
- Other Designated Contacts
- Assignment of Security Responsibility
- Information System Operational Status
- Information System Type
- General System Description
- System Environment
- System Interconnections/Information Sharing
- Related Laws/Regulations/Policies
- **Minimum Security Controls**
- Information System Security Plan Completion Date
- Information System Security Plan Approval Date

The Security Controls section should provide:

> [...] a thorough description of how all the minimum security controls
> in the applicable baseline are being implemented or planned to be
> implemented. The description should contain:
> 1) the security control title;
> 2) how the security control is being implemented or planned to be implemented;
> 3) any scoping guidance that has been applied and what type of consideration;
> 4) indicate if the security control is a common control 
>    and who is responsible for its implementation.
