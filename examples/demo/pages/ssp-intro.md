title: System Security Plan - Template
---

## Overview

[NIST-800-18] provides a sample information system security plan template
in Appendix A.  It also notes:

> Agencies may be using other formats and choose to update those to reflect
> any existing omissions based on this guidance. This is not a mandatory
> format; it is recognized that numerous agencies and information security
> service providers may have developed and implemented various approaches
> for information system security plan development and presentation to
> suit their own needs for flexibility.

This is as good a place to start as any.
