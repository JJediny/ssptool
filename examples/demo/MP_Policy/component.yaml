      text: |
        All sensitive data, including application and server logs,
        are disposed of using an Ultron-4000 Mark 2 industrial grade
        paper shredder.

      text: |
        The Ultron-4000 Mark 2 is only capable of shredding 400 pages
        per minute, and is therefore reserved for use on security-sensitive
        data (we go through a lot of paper for some reason).

        Excess server logs are fed to our backup disposal system,
        a FloraColossus-X Redwood-class wood chipper.
