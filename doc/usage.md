# Basic usage

Should work out of the box as a basic data browser
in any directory with OpenControl content (an `opencontrol.yaml` file):

```
compliance-masonry get
ssptool server
```

Then point your web browser at localhost:3000

This will present a menu allowing you to browse
the raw OpenControl data, viz:

- Controls
- Components
- Certifications


# Generating documents

_TBD_.
